                                        Applied Data Science II: Machine Learning & Statistical Analysis
                                        
In Unit II, students learn how to build machine learning models to make predictions based on real-world data. They will understand the best way to treat, clean, and encode data and how to choose the appropriate machine learning models for the task. They will properly tune the model to create a generalized model that performs well on both a training set and on out-of-sample data. They will learn how to build models using text and time series data.
